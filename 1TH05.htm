 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake. </div><div class='p'>Be at peace among yourselves.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Rejoice always.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Pray without ceasing.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Don’t quench the Spirit.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Don’t despise prophesies.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Abstain from every form of evil. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.
