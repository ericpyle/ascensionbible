 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. </div><ul class='tnav'>
