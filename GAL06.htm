 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>For each man will bear his own burden.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised; just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
