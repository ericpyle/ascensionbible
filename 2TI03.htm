For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, Every writing inspired by God is</span></a> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. </div><ul class='tnav'>
