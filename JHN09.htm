 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” </div><div class='p'>He said, “I am he.”  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class='wj'>‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, “Where is he?” </div><div class='p'>He said, “I don’t know.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” </div><div class='p'>He said, “He is a prophet.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 66:18, Proverbs 15:29; 28:9</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw him out. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class='wj'>“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span> </div><ul class='tnav'>
