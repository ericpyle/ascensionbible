 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come to me soon,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </div><ul class='tnav'>
