 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified?  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Deuteronomy 27:26</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Habakkuk 2:4</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Leviticus 18:5</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Deuteronomy 21:23</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> He doesn’t say, “To descendants<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, seeds</span></a>”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a>”,<a href="#FN9" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7</span></a> which is Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring<a href="#FN10" class="notemark">§<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span>If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring<a href="#FN11" class="notemark">**<span class="popup">or, seed</span></a> and heirs according to promise. </div><ul class='tnav'>
