 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, “Come and see!”  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Another came out, a red horse.

There was given to him a great sword. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures saying, “A choenix <a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">A choenix is a dry volume measure that is a little more than a liter (a little more than a quart).</span></a> of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius!

Hades <a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">or, Hell</span></a> followed with him.
