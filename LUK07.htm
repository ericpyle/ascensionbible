 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>A certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Soon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, <span class='wj'>“Don’t cry.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>He came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span class='wj'>“Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He who was dead sat up, and began to speak.
