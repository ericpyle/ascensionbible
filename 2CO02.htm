 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>This punishment which was inflicted by the many is sufficient for such a one;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ. </div><ul class='tnav'>
