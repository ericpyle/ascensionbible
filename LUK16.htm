 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>He also said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you?
