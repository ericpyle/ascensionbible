Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For this is loving God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>For there are three who testify<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Only a few recent manuscripts add “in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.

He who doesn’t believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>He who has the Son has the life. He who doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have the life.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death.
