No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces!
