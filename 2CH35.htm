Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>They removed the <span class='k'>ascensions</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).
