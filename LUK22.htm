 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He sent Peter and John, saying, <span class='wj'>“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class='wj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class='wj'>“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail.

Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 53:12</span></a> <span class='wj'>For that which concerns me has an end.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” </div><div class='p'>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“That is enough.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class='wj'>“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”  <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear, and healed him.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.  <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” </div><div class='p'>But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>He went out, and wept bitterly. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.  <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy!
