 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, “This is what Yahweh says, ‘Let my people go, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.’”  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Pharaoh, “I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>He said, “Tomorrow.” </div><div class='p'>He said, “Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like Yahweh our God.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people.

There were lice on man, and on animal.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is God’s finger:” and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes out to the water; and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh says, “Let my people go, that they may serve me.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh on the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be.”’”  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>Moses said, “It isn’t appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won’t they stone us?  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away.
