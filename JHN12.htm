 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Mary, therefore, took a pound<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">a Roman pound of 12 ounces, or about 340 grams</span></a> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>“Why wasn’t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">300 denarii was about a year’s wages for an agricultural laborer.</span></a> and given to the poor?”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For you always have the poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, “Hosanna!<a href="#FN3" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">“Hosanna” means “save us” or “help us, we pray”.</span></a> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,<a href="#FN4" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Psalm 118:25-26 </span></a> the King of Israel!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>“Don’t be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”<a href="#FN5" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Zechariah 9:9</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, was testifying about it.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&nbsp;</span>Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&nbsp;</span>These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&nbsp;</span>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Now my soul is troubled.

Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“This voice hasn’t come for my sake, but for your sakes. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.  <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered him, “We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<a href="#FN6" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44 (but see also Isaiah 53:8)</span></a> How do you say, <span class='wj'>‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’</span> Who is this Son of Man?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class='wj'>“Yet a little while the light is with you.

He who walks in the darkness doesn’t know where he is going. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light.”</span> Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn’t believe in him,  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, </div><div class='q'>“Lord, who has believed our report? </div><div class='q2'>To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<a href="#FN7" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 53:1</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>For this cause they couldn’t believe, for Isaiah said again, </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>“He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, </div><div class='q2'>lest they should see with their eyes, </div><div class='q2'>and perceive with their heart, </div><div class='q2'>and would turn, </div><div class='q2'>and I would heal them.”<a href="#FN8" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 6:10</span></a> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him. <a href="#FN9" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Isaiah 6:1</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn’t confess it, so that they wouldn’t be put out of the synagogue,  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>for they loved men’s praise more than God’s praise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>Jesus cried out and said, <span class='wj'>“Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He who sees me sees him who sent me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn’t believe, I don’t judge him.
