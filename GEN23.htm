This was the length of Sarah’s life.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>“I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>“Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>He talked with them, saying, “If you agree that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me among you as a possession for a burial place.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>“No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you.
