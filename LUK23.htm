 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” </div><div class='p'>He answered him, <span class='wj'>“So you say.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">NU omits verse 17.</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man!

Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&nbsp;</span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&nbsp;</span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&nbsp;</span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class='wj'>“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Hosea 10:8</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span> </div><div class='p'>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>The people stood watching.
