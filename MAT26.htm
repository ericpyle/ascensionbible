She has done a good work for me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>and said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand.

He gave to the disciples, and said, <span class='wj'>“Take, eat; this is my body.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&nbsp;</span>He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“All of you drink it, </span>  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” </span>  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&nbsp;</span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Zechariah 13:7</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&nbsp;</span>But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span>  <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class='wj'>“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&nbsp;</span>Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, <span class='wj'>“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.” </span>  <span class="verse" id="V43">43&nbsp;</span>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.  <span class="verse" id="V44">44&nbsp;</span>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.  <span class="verse" id="V45">45&nbsp;</span>Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”  <span class="verse" id="V49">49&nbsp;</span>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Friend, why are you here?”</span> Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <span class="verse" id="V51">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.  <span class="verse" id="V52">52&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V53">53&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V54">54&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” </span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&nbsp;</span>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V56">56&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span> </div><div class='p'>Then all the disciples left him, and fled.  <span class="verse" id="V57">57&nbsp;</span>Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.  <span class="verse" id="V58">58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.  <span class="verse" id="V59">59&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;  <span class="verse" id="V60">60&nbsp;</span>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,  <span class="verse" id="V61">61&nbsp;</span>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&nbsp;</span>The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”  <span class="verse" id="V63">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.  <span class="verse" id="V66">66&nbsp;</span>What do you think?” </div><div class='p'>They answered, “He is worthy of death!”  <span class="verse" id="V67">67&nbsp;</span>Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,  <span class="verse" id="V68">68&nbsp;</span>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&nbsp;</span>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&nbsp;</span>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&nbsp;</span>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V72">72&nbsp;</span>Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V73">73&nbsp;</span>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V74">74&nbsp;</span>Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” </div><div class='p'>Immediately the rooster crowed.  <span class="verse" id="V75">75&nbsp;</span>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> He went out and wept bitterly. </div><ul class="cmenu">
