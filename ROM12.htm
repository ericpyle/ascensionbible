 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another;  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&nbsp;</span>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath.
