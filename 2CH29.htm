 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of Yahweh’s house, and repaired them.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the wide place on the east,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify Yahweh, the God of your fathers’ house, and carry the filthiness out of the holy place.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For our fathers were unfaithful, and have done that which was evil in Yahweh our God’s sight, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered <span class='w'>ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

All this continued until the <span class='w'>ascension</span><a href="#FN6" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

All these were for an <span class='w'>ascension</span><a href="#FN9" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).

Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Also the <span class='w'>ascensions|ascension</span><a href="#FN11" class="notemark">‡<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).
