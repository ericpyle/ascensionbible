 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh’s ark was in the country of the Philistines seven months.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with Yahweh’s ark? Show us how we should send it to its place.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return a trespass offering to him. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>Then they said, “What should the trespass offering be which we shall return to him?” </div><div class='p'>They said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will release his hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn’t they let the people go, and they departed? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>“Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>and take Yahweh’s ark, and lay it on the cart. Put the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us.

They went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone. Then they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for an <span class='k'>ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).
