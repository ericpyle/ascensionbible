Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&nbsp;</span>While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.  <span class="verse" id="V35">35&nbsp;</span>A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”  <span class="verse" id="V36">36&nbsp;</span>When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&nbsp;</span>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.  <span class="verse" id="V38">38&nbsp;</span>Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.  <span class="verse" id="V39">39&nbsp;</span>Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.  <span class="verse" id="V40">40&nbsp;</span>I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you?

It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&nbsp;</span>There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.  <span class="verse" id="V47">47&nbsp;</span>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,  <span class="verse" id="V48">48&nbsp;</span>and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me.
