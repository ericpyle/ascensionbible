Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&nbsp;</span>When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.”  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&nbsp;</span>Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&nbsp;</span>You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you.
