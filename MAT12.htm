His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him; </span>  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>how he entered into God’s house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">1 Samuel 21:3-6</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless? </span>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup">Hosea 6:6</span></a> <span class='wj'>you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless. </span>  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span> </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>He departed there, and went into their synagogue.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>And behold there was a man with a withered hand.
