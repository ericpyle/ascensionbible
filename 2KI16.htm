 <span class="verse" id="V1">1&nbsp;</span>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&nbsp;</span>Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in Yahweh his God’s eyes, like David his father.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&nbsp;</span>But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&nbsp;</span>He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&nbsp;</span>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war. They besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&nbsp;</span>At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&nbsp;</span>So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&nbsp;</span>Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in Yahweh’s house, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&nbsp;</span>The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&nbsp;</span>King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest a drawing of the altar and plans to build it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&nbsp;</span>Urijah the priest built an altar. According to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&nbsp;</span>When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar, and offered on it.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&nbsp;</span>He burned his <span class='k'>ascension</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah). Typically rendered “burnt offering(s)” in English Bibles. </span></a> and his meal offering, poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&nbsp;</span>The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the front of the house, from between his altar and Yahweh’s house, and put it on the north side of his altar.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&nbsp;</span>King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the morning <span class='k'>ascension</span><a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup">Hebrew עֹלָה (`olah).
